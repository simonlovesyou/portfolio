# Jade HTML5 Boilerplate
> Simple port of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) to [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)

All credit goes to the [original contributors](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/graphs/contributors).

Discretionary portions of the original HTML5 Boilerplate are included,
but left as unbuffered comments by default. Uncomment to enable them.

`layout.jade` uses [Express](http://expressjs.com)-based resource paths,
while `layout_vanilla.jade` uses the originals.

Run `./build` to output the templates as HTML files.

Run `./test` to test the template renderings against references.

Tested with Jade `1.1.5`.
